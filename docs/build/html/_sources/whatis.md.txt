# What is ZooxantelaPy ?

ZooxantelaPy is a toolkit in [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/) for processing ocean bottom seismometer data.

The seismic events from ocean subsurface is a key component for understanding the Earth's dynamic interior. It thus needs a continuous monitoring to help scientists better understand its dynamic and predict its evolution. All around the world, seismologists want to join their efforts and set up a global monitoring.
