# Requirements

The code is developped on Ubuntu with Python Python 3.7.

In addition to [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/), you need
to install the following packages: 

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)

*I suggest to use the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/) to install your packages.
