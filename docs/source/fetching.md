# Fetching OBS data

*MiniSEED* is a stripped down version of SEED containing only waveform data. There is no station and channel metadata included In particular, such as geographic coordinates, response/scale and other useful information for interpreting data values.
Time series are values independently fixed length data, each containing a small segment of length values.

A miniSEED reader is necessary to reconstruct the time series, in this case use [OBSPY](https://docs.obspy.org/) to read the files generated by the [GCF2MSD](https://www.guralp.com/sw/gcf2msd.shtml) program from Guralp. A miniSEED “File” or “Stream” is simply a concatenation of data records. The OBS data were organized according to how the data from the Brazilian Seismographic Network [RSBR](http://rsbr.gov.br/). The dataset is divided according to the sensor components, where each folder contains 1-day-sized files that have already been preprocessed. 

*StationXML is an XML representation of metadata that describes the data collected by geophysical instrumentation. StationXML was developed through the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN) to provide a standardized format for geophysical metadata.
